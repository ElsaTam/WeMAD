# WeMAD

## About

WeMAD (Weird and Magical Affairs Department) is a fictive law enforcement agency set in a fictive universe for a roleplaying game, created by myself and the players. It falls under the subgenre of contemporary urban fantasy, which means that it is based on real events and people with the addition of supernatural elements.

However, we don't make any reference to any real people in this website. This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are products of the authorâ€™s imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.

This website is a small excerpt of what could be the WeMAD website for agents. For now, features can be sumarized as follow:
- searchable database of people from different supernatural origins, outlaws, prisoners, other agents, etc;
- list of all WeMAD offices in the United States, with an interactive map;
- list of organisations dealing with supernatural around the world, with an interactive map;
- knowledges and scientific reports (fictitious);

Note that all content is in french.

## Website development

WeMAD website is fully developed by myself, with the open-source PHP framework Laravel. It is a long-time running project, on which I can work from time to time with the goal to add content (details about the universe, lore knowledge, people, etc.) and features.

The website is deployed and can be accessed at [https://wemad.fly.dev/](https://wemad.fly.dev/), however you might encounter server error, as the database goes to sleep after a period of inactivity. I developed the website for my friends and I, without focusing on large public access.
